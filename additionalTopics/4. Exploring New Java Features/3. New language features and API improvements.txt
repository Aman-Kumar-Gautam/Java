Java continues to evolve with each new release, introducing new language features, API improvements, and enhancements to the platform. Hereâ€™s an overview of some notable additions and improvements in recent Java versions:

Java 9
Module System (Project Jigsaw):
Introduces the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) for creating modular applications, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
JShell (Java Shell):
Interactive command-line tool for evaluating Java code snippets and experimenting with APIs without needing a full application setup.
Private Methods in Interfaces:
Allows interface methods to have private implementation, enabling code reuse and organization within interfaces.
Improved Stream API:
Adds several new methods to streamline common tasks in the Stream API, such as takeWhile, dropWhile, iterate.
Collection Factory Methods:
Introduces static factory methods (List.of(), Set.of(), Map.of()) for creating immutable instances of collections.
Java 10
Local-Variable Type Inference (var keyword):
Allows local variables to be declared with inferred types, reducing boilerplate code (var list = new ArrayList<String>();).
Parallel Full GC for G1:
Enhances the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector to perform full garbage collections in parallel, improving performance.
Application Class-Data Sharing (CDS):
Improves startup time and memory footprint by sharing common class metadata across JVM instances.
Java 11
HTTP Client (Standard):
Introduces a new HTTP API (java.net.http.HttpClient) for making HTTP requests natively in Java.
Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters:
Extends the var keyword to lambda expressions, allowing parameters to be declared with inferred types in lambda expressions.
Enhanced String API:
Adds several methods to the String class for easier manipulation and checking (isBlank(), lines(), strip(), repeat()).
Java 12
Switch Expressions (Preview):
Enhances the switch statement to be used as an expression, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability.
Compact Number Formatting:
Introduces CompactNumberFormat for compact and localized number formatting (NumberFormat.getCompactNumberInstance()).
JVM Constants API (Preview):
Defines a new API (java.lang.invoke.constant) for creating and using symbolic references to constants dynamically.
Java 13
Text Blocks (Preview):
Introduces raw string literals (""" ... """) for multi-line string literals, improving readability and simplifying escape sequences.
Switch Expressions (Standard):
Makes switch expressions a standard feature, enhancing usability and compatibility across Java applications.
Reimplement the Legacy Socket API:
Rewrites the underlying implementation of the legacy Socket API to improve maintainability, performance, and security.
Java 14
Records (Preview):
Introduces a new type of class called records (record keyword) for concise data carriers with auto-generated methods (constructors, getters).
Pattern Matching for instanceof (Preview):
Enhances the instanceof operator with pattern matching to simplify type casts and conditional extraction of components.
Java 15
Sealed Classes and Interfaces (Preview):
Introduces sealed classes (sealed keyword) and interfaces (permits clause) for restricting the inheritance hierarchy, improving code security and maintainability.
Text Blocks (Standard):
Makes text blocks a standard feature, enhancing readability of multi-line string literals.
Java 16
Records (Standard):

Records become a standard feature, providing a compact syntax for declaring classes whose primary purpose is to store data.
Pattern Matching for instanceof (Standard):

Pattern matching for instanceof becomes a standard feature, allowing pattern variables to be used in conditional instanceof checks.
Java 17
Sealed Classes and Interfaces (Standard):

Sealed classes and interfaces become a standard feature, allowing the declaration of classes and interfaces that can only be extended or implemented by a specified set of classes.
Switch Expressions Enhancements:

Adds enhancements to switch expressions, including extended case labels and relaxed scoping.
API Improvements
Enhancements across Core APIs: Continual improvements to existing APIs, such as enhancements to the Stream API, Collections API, Concurrency API, and more.

Platform Enhancements: Security updates, performance improvements, and bug fixes across the Java platform.

How to Keep Up
Official Java Documentation: Read release notes and documentation for each Java version on Oracle's Java SE Documentation page.

Community Resources: Follow Java blogs, forums, and community websites to stay updated on new features and best practices.

Experimentation: Download Early Access builds, participate in Java User Groups (JUGs), and experiment with new features in your projects to gain hands-on experience.

By staying informed and actively experimenting with new features, Java developers can leverage the latest language enhancements and API improvements to build more efficient, maintainable, and modern Java applications.
